# Core Values

At BoostDraft, our management and employees are united in the commitment to foster an outstanding work environment and drive meaningful innovation.


### Innovation to the World

As a startup, we’re dedicated to making an impact. Our initial innovation in the legal industry is just the beginning of our journey to drive progress in various fields.


### Best Work Environment

Work is an integral part of life. We respect the diverse needs and preferences of our team, considering family life and personal goals as we create an environment where everyone can perform at their best and enjoy their work in fulfilling ways.


### Personal Growth

Every team member should have opportunities to develop their skills through meaningful work. We encourage everyone to take on new challenges and continually learn. When you look back, we hope you’ll feel that BoostDraft empowered you to reach new heights in your career.


# Communication Guidelines

In a team that brings together people from diverse cultures and backgrounds, we understand that assumptions may not always align. 
Our communication guidelines are designed to create a comfortable and collaborative environment for everyone, ensuring the best experience and performance for all.


### (Extra effort to align assumptions [])

Without shared context and aligned assumptions, it can be challenging for diverse team members to stay on the same page. 
To promote effective discussions, it’s essential to clarify and align assumptions before exchanging opinions, leading to more meaningful and efficient conversations.


### (Direct communication and positive intent [])

In some cultures, direct communication might be seen as impolite. At BoostDraft, however, direct communication is our default to accelerate innovation and personal growth. 
It’s equally important to listen with positive intent, understanding that direct feedback is intended constructively. Trust that all members are communicating with respect and a genuine interest in each other's growth.


### (Explicitly show respect [])

Working in a fully remote environment can make it more challenging to build trust. 
Showing respect explicitly in every interaction is essential to fostering collaboration and maintaining a positive team atmosphere.


### (Logic over experience [])

When contributing to team discussions, sharing your experiences is valuable—but it’s essential to explain the insights you've gained from them. 
Instead of saying, “In my experience…” focus on why and how your experience is relevant to the discussion. Emphasizing the reasoning behind your perspective will help elevate the conversation and invite everyone to benefit from each other’s unique backgrounds.


# Behaviour Guidelines

hese guidelines help shape how we work, make decisions, and interact with one another to uphold our core values.


### (Distributed-autonomy and self-drive [])
At BoostDraft, each team member has the freedom and responsibility to make decisions and drive their work autonomously. In a distributed environment, self-drive is essential for success.
We encourage everyone to set clear goals, manage their time effectively, and proactively seek solutions. Trust your instincts, ask for support when needed, and remember that each decision you make contributes to the bigger picture.


### (Ownership for product and organization [])

Taking ownership means treating the product and the company as if they were your own. Each member is responsible for not only their work but also the overall success of BoostDraft. 
Whether it’s a small feature or a strategic decision, approach every task with accountability and pride. Ownership also includes addressing challenges, sharing ideas for improvement, and supporting others in their work. When we all act as owners, we collectively drive the company forward.


### (Ask users before half-complete [])

User feedback is invaluable in our development process. Don’t wait until a product is fully polished to reach out for feedback—engage users early and often, even if the feature is only partially developed. 
This approach helps us align our work with real user needs, identify potential issues, and adapt quickly based on their insights. Frequent user feedback not only enhances our product but also reinforces our commitment to building solutions that truly serve our users.


### (Codify and update guideline [])

Guidelines are living documents that should evolve with the company. As we grow and learn, we may encounter new scenarios or develop more efficient processes. 
Whenever possible, codify what works well into guidelines and refine them based on real experiences. This ensures that everyone has access to the latest insights and best practices, promoting consistency and clarity across the team.


### (Transparency by default [])

Open communication and transparency are fundamental at BoostDraft. By default, share information openly, whether it’s about company goals, product developments, or feedback. 
Transparency fosters trust, enables informed decision-making, and encourages everyone to contribute their ideas and opinions. We believe that when people have access to information, they are empowered to act with purpose and confidence.


### (Creativity for Speed [])

Innovation and efficiency go hand in hand at BoostDraft. We encourage creative problem-solving that enables us to work faster and adapt quickly. 
Embrace unconventional ideas and be open to new approaches that can help us achieve our goals more effectively. By fostering a culture of creativity, we’re able to keep up with the demands of our fast-paced environment without compromising on quality.
