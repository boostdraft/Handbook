# Core Values

At BoostDraft, our management and employees are united in the commitment to foster an outstanding work environment and drive meaningful innovation.


### Innovation to the World

As a startup, we’re dedicated to making an impact. Our initial innovation in the legal industry is just the beginning of our journey to drive progress in various fields.


### Best Work Environment

Work is an integral part of life. We respect the diverse needs and preferences of our team, considering family life and personal goals as we create an environment where everyone can perform at their best and enjoy their work in fulfilling ways.


### Personal Growth

Every team member should have opportunities to develop their skills through meaningful work. We encourage everyone to take on new challenges and continually learn. When you look back, we hope you’ll feel that BoostDraft empowered you to reach new heights in your career.


# Communication Guidelines

In a team that brings together people from diverse cultures and backgrounds, we understand that assumptions may not always align. 
Our communication guidelines are designed to create a comfortable and collaborative environment for everyone, ensuring the best experience and performance for all.


### (Extra effort to align assumptions [])

Without shared context and aligned assumptions, it can be challenging for diverse team members to stay on the same page. 
To promote effective discussions, it’s essential to clarify and align assumptions before exchanging opinions, leading to more meaningful and efficient conversations.


### (Direct communication and positive intent [])

In some cultures, direct communication might be seen as impolite. At BoostDraft, however, direct communication is our default to accelerate innovation and personal growth. 
It’s equally important to listen with positive intent, understanding that direct feedback is intended constructively. Trust that all members are communicating with respect and a genuine interest in each other's growth.


### (Explicitly show respect [])

Working in a fully remote environment can make it more challenging to build trust. 
Showing respect explicitly in every interaction is essential to fostering collaboration and maintaining a positive team atmosphere.


### (Logic over experience [])

When contributing to team discussions, sharing your experiences is valuable—but it’s essential to explain the insights you've gained from them. 
Instead of saying, “In my experience…” focus on why and how your experience is relevant to the discussion. Emphasizing the reasoning behind your perspective will help elevate the conversation and invite everyone to benefit from each other’s unique backgrounds.


# Behaviour Guidelines

### (Distributed-autonomy and self-drive [])


### (Ownership for product and organization [])

Tasks that are not assigned to anyone else are your tasks. And even if you ask another member of the team to assist you, it does not mean that it is out of your hands, and you are strongly expected to take responsibility for checking the status and that it is working correctly. 


### (Ask users before half-complete [])

### (Codify and update guideline [])

### (Transparency by default [])

### (Creativity for Speed [])
