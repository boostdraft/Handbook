Extra effort to align assumption　前提のずれをなくすために努力しよう
Issue: background and events are considered differently by different people, and if you don't do it, you will get completely different results. (Even within the company, the assumption that this is how it should be is different for each position or position)
Improvement: e.g. ‘This is about ●.’ It is important to make a concise list of the main points that you want them to know. Consider the other person's background (what they know and what information they need).
Direct communication and positive intent listening 直接的に伝え、聞く側は「いい意味で」を無意識に補間しよう
As a result of being reserved and indirect, the message can get distorted or end up not being conveyed at all, so it's important to communicate clearly. In doing so, it's better to combine directness with respect.


Explicitly show respect　尊敬を明文化しよう
issue case: 
We don't know each other's strengths and good points.
Deterioration of relations with other teams
How do you use the guidelines in your daily work?
Regardless of whether it's text or offline, in all communication settings


Logic over experience　経験を言語化して伝えよう
Issue cases : Only certain people know the characteristics of new and old installers, what kind of situations they are used in, how to look at the logs, and other information.
How to use the guideline in daily work: To some extent, experience is shared by writing in the slack about why the decision was made based on daily work.


Work process
Distributed-autonomy and self-drive　自律分散・自走主義
When rules and responsibilities are unclear, tasks are likely to stagnate, and action becomes difficult. 
By creating rules independently and taking action, if the outcome is positive, these actions can be established as new effective rules.
Ownership for product and organization	「自分が」会社・プロダクトを作っているとして行動しよう
[Issue Case]
No one responds and the response to customers and other team members is delayed.
As a result of no one focusing on the project, the quality is half-hearted and progress is slow.
[Suggestions]
Making response to customers faster, no more omissions.
The quality of the results will be higher because the level of commitment will be higher.
Ask users before half-complete		作り込む前にユーザーに問おう
[Issue Case]Take too much time and too read between the lines of the customer’s questions so that it sometimes makes a complicated situation.
Don't read too much into the customer's question and answer simply.
[Issue Case]We are not sure when the customer’s request is reflected on the new release
[Suggestion]We would like to have a session with engineers if the new features suit customer’s request before release it.
Codify and update guideline　ガイドラインを言語化・アップデートしよう
Different things being done for the same thing as a few months ago -> Work needs to be updated to suit the occasion.
Situation where each member covers a wide range of work → Efficient work is possible through a common understanding.


Transparency by default		公開がデフォルト。DMを避けよう
If you use direct messages to hide your mistakes or errors, the issue can escalate. To ensure everyone is informed, make public sharing the default.
Creativity for Speed		最速を実現するためにクリエイティビティ
There are times when things do not progress due to reasons such as "not knowing the rules or procedures." Without knowing how to make proposals or consult, discussions with clients or internally can stall, leading to halted progress.
 By freely proposing and consulting, including using one's own quick-thinking format or ideas, progress can be made at the fastest pace.
