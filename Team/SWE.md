## What kind of bad things would happen if we don't have this?
- Spent too much time developing on wrong/not-intuitive design and later it turns out that this is not customers want.
## Clarification (how to use the guideline?)
- Ask user's feedback (internal / external) as early as possible.
- Don't spend too much time on less important details before getting feedback.
- Iterating design only is much cheaper than redoing development and QA work.

# 8. Codify and update guideline　ガイドラインを言語化・アップデートしよう
## What kind of bad things would happen if we don't have this?
- Guildeline is updated but not everyone is aware of that.
- Mentor needs to explain the same thing repeatedly for new joingers.
- Information scatters across different places (GitHub, Notion, Goodle Docs, Slack, etc.).
- Waste of time to search for information.
## Clarification (how to use the guideline?)
- "You should be able to find the information by yourself by looking at XXX".
- "Before asking questions, search XXX by yourself."
## Additional comments
- Probably we're not doing great job here today.
- Creating a meta guildeline for guildeline? How to write guideline and how to search for guideline?
