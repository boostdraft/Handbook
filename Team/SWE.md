At BoostDraft, being proactive in taking on tasks and solving problems is essential, especially in a remote working environment where mutual trust and self-initiative are vital. Each team member is expected to identify and work on tasks independently without needing prompts from others. If challenges arise, reaching out for assistance and collaborating with the team ensures progress and shared success. It’s important to address and report any encountered bugs or identify the appropriate owners for follow-up. To apply this, seek out tasks that need attention and don’t hesitate to ask for help and resources when needed.
- Example of how you can apply this: Seek out tasks that need doing and be willing to ask for help and resources if you need them.
